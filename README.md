This is an example of a Stripes "platform". It consists simply of an NPM [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) that specifies the version of `@folio/stripes-core` and of any Stripes modules you wish to make available to generate client bundles.

Please see the [quick start guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/quick-start.md) for more information.

Also in this area: `stripes.config.js` is a configuration for a specific tenant. In general, a platform supports mutiple tentants, each of which may include a different set of the available modules.
